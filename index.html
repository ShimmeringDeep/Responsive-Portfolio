<div id="bio">
    <p>As a child, I was constantly around computers. My brother was a web developer at Rolling Stone in the 90s, and I would sometimes go to Manhattan to spend time with him. He was also a gaming columnist for the Mac Observer, and I quickly took on his love for all things geek and tech. I remember sitting in his office in his tiny flat in NYC playing Carmageddon, he'd chuckle as I mowed down civilians. I was even a part of <a style="color: lightgrey" href="https://www.macobserver.com/columns/nameofthegame/99/december/991221.html"> his Descent 3 review.</a></p>
<br>
    <p>In highschool I moved to California, where I saw my pursuits trend towards the artistic and athletic. I was beginning to succeed in track until I spent time in and out of the hospital with medical issues (all resolved now, thankfully), but even through the worst of it I found my peace in video games and Dungeons and Dragons with my closest friends. The geek remained strong within me.</p>
<br>
    <p>Into college and my younger 20s, academics were second to the more frivolous pursuit of drinking and carrying on. Luckily the Geek is stong in me, and I became encyclopaedic in my beer knowledge. I exited the college scene to pursue my new found love of drink. I began working at a small wine bar in the heart of Montrose. I don't name it now because I don't necessarily reccomend it, but it eventually got me noticed and hired at a little pub in Rice Village called the Ginger Man.</p>
<br>
    <p>The Ginger Man is where I learned to pair my geekiness with an excellent work ethic to succeed. I was hired on as a part-time door guy, but kept grinding, and flexing my beer knowledge, until they promoted me to barback, then waiter, then bartender, and finally management.</p>
<br>
    <p>After managing at the Ginger Man for a couple years, I decided that it was time to pursue new avenues within the industry. I left with the knowledge of how to motivate a team and how to keep staff well educated in a constantly changing a growing world, and I left to teach myself a new world: craft cocktail bartending.</p>
<br>
    <p>At the Queen Vic Pub and Kitchen, I was thrown into the fire. Having to immediately learn an entirely new kind of bartending. But my love of learning propelled me through and soon I was creating new house cocktails, and creating a following among cockatil lovers near Greenway Plaza, but as I was again promoted to management I realised that this was a cycle. I would never gain the capital to open my own bar, nor impact the world in the way I realised I had always dreamed. So I looked deep inside myself for answers, but none came. Until my sister reminded me of my love of tech and creation. She said Gary, my now late brother, had the same passions I had, why not pursue a career working in computers.</p>
<br>
    <p>I had no idea what I was getting into, but when I began my coursework at UT Austin's Coding BootCamp I found a third love of mine: creating webpages and writing code. It's been a long journey thus far, and that's where I find myself today, eagerly drinking in all the knowledge I can as I scramble my way to success as a full-stack developer.</p>
